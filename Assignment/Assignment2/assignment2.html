        </header>

            <p id="paragraph">Protected areas are the cornerstone of biodiversity conservation; they maintain key habitats, provide refugia, allow for species migration and movement, and ensure the maintenance of natural processes across the landscape. Not only do protected areas secure biodiversity conservation, they also secure the well-being of humanity itself. Protected areas provide livelihoods for nearly 1.1 billion people, are the primary source of drinking water for over a third of the world's largest cities and are a major factor in ensuring global food security. Well managed protected areas harbouring participatory and equitable governance mechanisms yield significant benefits far beyond their boundaries, which can be translated into cumulative advantages across a national economy and contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable development including achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. As the detrimental impact of climate change threatens the planet, protected areas provide a convenient solution to an inconvenient truth. Better managed, better connected, better governed and better financed protected areas are recognized as the key to both mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change.

            <h4>Greenpeace International</h4>
            <img src="images/Greenpeace.jpg" alt="Greenpeace image">
            <p>We want to live on a healthy, peaceful planet. A planet where forests flourish, oceans are full of life and where once-threatened animals safely roam.
                Where our quality of life is measured in relationships, not things. Where our food is delicious, nutritious, and grown with love. Where the air we breathe is fresh and clear. Where our energy is as clean as a mountain stream. Where everyone has the security, dignity and joy we all deserve.        
                It's all possible. We can't make it happen alone, but have no doubt: We can do it together.</p>

            <p>With nature, we build a thriving world. The interconnection of people and nature is the Nature Conservancy of Canada's (NCC's) foundation; the idea that we are all one with nature. Together, through purposeful actions, we have the opportunity to build toward a greater good â€” a thriving world. Because when nature thrives, people thrive.</p>
